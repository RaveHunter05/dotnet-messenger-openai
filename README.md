### Connection Facebook Messenger with Database and LLM .dotnet Core API

This project is made with the purpose to connect Facebook Messenger with a Database and a Language Model (LLM) using .NET Core API. The application allows users to interact with a database through Facebook Messenger, leveraging the capabilities of a language model for natural language processing.

The idea is to help business owners to attend their customers in a more efficient way, providing quick and accurate responses to punctual questions about their products or services. All the information is stored in a database, which can be queried using natural language thanks to the integration with a language model.

### Features
- Integration with Facebook Messenger for seamless communication.
- Connection to a database to store and retrieve information.
- Utilization of a Language Model (LLM) for natural language understanding and response generation.
- Built with .NET Core for robust and scalable API development.

### Prerequisites
- .NET Core SDK
- Facebook Developer Account
- Database (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL, etc.)
- Access to a Language Model API (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.)
